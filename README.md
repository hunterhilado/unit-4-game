# Link to game: https://hunterhilado.github.io/unit-4-game/

## Programs used: HTML, CSS, jQuery

## Directions:
- Shown on the screen are four crystals, each assigned a randomly generated variable every round from 1-12.
- The crystals hide the amount they are from the player so you need to remember what the amount is per crystal!
- The goal of the game is to match your current score to the computers randomly chosen variable. 
- If you correctly match the number to the computers chosen number you win and gain a point in the win column!
- If you go over you lose and gain a point in the losses column.

## How it functions:
- Each crystal has a randomly generated number that is hidden to the player. Once its clicked it updates the HTML page to reflect the new amount.
- The computers choice is randmoly generated as well at the start on the HTML.
- If the user matches their score to the computers variable they win and the wins column is updated.
- If the user goes over the computers variable they lose and a point is added to the losses column.
- Once the game is over there is a working button that restarts the game
